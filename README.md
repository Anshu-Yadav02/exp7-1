Title
Connecting React Frontend to Express API Using Axios

Objective
Learn how to connect a React frontend application to a backend Express.js API using Axios to fetch data. This task helps you understand how to integrate frontend and backend parts of a full stack application and handle HTTP requests in React.

Task Description
Create a simple Express.js API that returns a list of products (each with a name and price). Then, build a React frontend application with a component that uses Axios to fetch the product data from the Express API when the component mounts. Display the list of products in a user-friendly layout, showing their name and price. Ensure you handle loading states and possible errors when fetching data. Test the connection by running both the frontend and backend locally and verifying that the React app correctly displays data fetched from the Express API.
